 *  serializers, watcher tick drivers, or any other higher-level orchestration:
 *  those belong in domain-specific deps bags, not in the network seam.
 *
 *  All cross-machine communication that the runtime initiates or observes
 *  flows through this interface. Sub-systems must not reach for sockets,
 *  sessions, or remote-player state directly.
 *
 *  Production wiring:
 *    - Local play (main.ts): no-op `send` and `onMessage`, always host,
 *      spectator slot, empty remote set.
 *    - Online (online/runtime/game.ts): WebSocket `send`, fan-out
 *      `onMessage`, host/slot/remote state read from `ctx.session`.
 *    - Tests (test/runtime-headless.ts): no-op send + spectator slot today.
 *      A future "machines" abstraction will wire multiple NetworkApi
 *      instances together via an in-memory message bus, exercising the
 *      same dispatch path as production without a real WebSocket.
 *
 *  `amHost` (not `isHost`) sidesteps the eslint rule banning direct
 *  `.isHost` property access — that rule exists because the session's
 *  `isHost` field is volatile and must never be cached. Reading
 *  `network.amHost()` is always fresh. The other getters (`myPlayerId`,
