/**
 * E2E network test: THREE real human players, one quits mid-game, and the two
 * survivors must keep playing the SAME game to the end.
 *
 * Models three humans on three browsers, connected through the real Deno server:
 *   - host  → creates a room, seats itself in slot 0
 *   - peer1 → joins, seats itself in slot 1
 *   - peer2 → joins, seats itself in slot 2
 *
 * Partway through the match one peer CLOSES ITS BROWSER (the quit), the same
 * way a real player closing the tab / losing their connection would. WHO quits
 * and WHEN are parameters:
 *   - HOST (slot 0) quits → host migration: the server promotes the lowest-slot
 *     survivor to host, that peer broadcasts a FULL_STATE checkpoint, and every
 *     survivor adopts it (src/online/runtime/promote.ts). Different quit phases
 *     (CANNON_PLACE, BATTLE, WALL_BUILD, UPGRADE_PICK) land in different
 *     promotion-repair branches.
 *   - NON-host (slot 1/2) quits → NO migration: the server parks the seat and
 *     the unchanged host schedules an AI takeover (online-seat-takeover.ts).
 *
 * After the quit the two survivors play on (the quitter's seat becomes AI). The
 * test asserts:
 *   1. host identity is correct — exactly one survivor is host, and it is the
 *      lowest surviving slot (the promoted survivor on a host quit, or the
 *      unchanged slot-0 host on a non-host quit; a broken migration otherwise
 *      only surfaces as a slow game-over timeout);
 *   2. the survivors never diverge — the same N-peer round-boundary monitor as
 *      two-humans-online.ts watches per-slot lives/score every round and stops
 *      at the first disagreement (the quitter is dropped from comparison, not
 *      flagged); and
 *   3. both survivors reach game-over with byte-identical state (rng cursor,
 *      per-slot state, towers, grunts, cannonballs) and agree on the winner.
 *
 * The minimal-human drive, the divergence monitor + per-sim-tick diagnosis, and
 * the parity snapshot all live in the shared harness (./online-humans.ts). Like
 * its two-human sibling it drives REAL keypresses over a REAL WebSocket /
 * server, MUST run non-headless (headless RAF throttling forks the co-hosted
 * sims — see ./online-humans.ts), is slow, and lives outside the pre-commit lane.
 *
 * Run: deno test --no-check -A test/e2e/three-humans-online.ts
 *      (E2E_HEADFUL=1 to watch the three browsers play)
 * Requires: npm run dev (vite on port 5173) AND deno task server (port 8001)
