/**
 * E2E network test: two real human players run a game to the end and must
 * observe the SAME game.
 *
 * Models two humans on two browsers, connected through the real Deno server:
 *   - host  → creates a room, seats itself in slot 0
 *   - client→ joins the room, seats itself in slot 1
 *   - slot 2 is left empty → the lobby fills it with an AI on start
 *
 * Each human plays minimally (see `driveMinimalHuman` in ./online-humans.ts):
 * seat, build poorly, but in battle AIM at the nearest enemy structure and
 * fire, and on a life loss pick CONTINUE or ABANDON at random. They build
 * badly, so the slot-2 AI beats them and the match runs to game-over.
 *
 * Divergence detection + diagnosis, the minimal-human drive, the per-sim-tick
 * recorder and the parity snapshot all live in the shared harness
 * (./online-humans.ts). This file only seats the two peers, runs them, and
 * asserts the end-of-game parity. See three-humans-online.ts for the
 * host-migration sibling.
 *
 * This is the only path that drives REAL human keypresses over a REAL
 * WebSocket / server (the headless parity tests stub the transport and drive an
 * AI brain on the human seat). It is slow and lives outside the pre-commit lane.
 *
 * Run: deno test --no-check -A test/e2e/two-humans-online.ts
 *      (E2E_HEADFUL=1 to watch the two browsers play)
 * Requires: npm run dev (vite on port 5173) AND deno task server (port 8001)
