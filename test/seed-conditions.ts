/**
 * Seed-condition registry — every drift-sensitive test's seed requirement
 * in one place.
 *
 * Each entry names a condition (e.g. `"upgrade:rapid_fire"`) and declares a
 * `match` function that subscribes to the bus and/or polls `sc.state` to
 * answer "has the condition fired yet?". The `scripts/record-seeds.ts`
 * scanner runs every seed, installs every matcher, and records the first
 * seed that satisfies each condition — all in a single pass.
 *
 * When RNG drifts:
 *
 *     npm run record-seeds
 *
 * rescans and rewrites `test/seed-fixtures.json`. Tests then load via:
 *
 *     const sc = await loadSeed("upgrade:rapid_fire");
 *
 * Adding a new condition
 * ----------------------
 * 1. Pick a unique dotted name: `{subsystem}:{specific-condition}`.
 * 2. Choose `mode` (classic/modern) and a `rounds` budget that gives the
 *    condition enough headroom to fire (10 is a safe default for modern).
 * 3. Write `match` as `(sc) => { install listeners; return () => hasFired }`.
 *    For one-shot events (most of them), latch a closure flag on the listener
 *    and return it in the poller — see the upgrade examples below.
 *
 * Rules
 * -----
 * - `match` must be deterministic: same seed → same poller result.
 * - The poller is invoked by `runUntil`, so keep it cheap (boolean flag read).
 * - Don't mutate `sc.state` — tests should observe, not drive.
