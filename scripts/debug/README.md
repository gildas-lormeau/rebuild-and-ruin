# debug — non-interactive CDP debugger CLI

A small CLI that drives a Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) session against
Node, Deno, or any V8-based runtime. The headline feature is **capture
points**: a breakpoint that auto-resumes after recording a snapshot of
named expressions, returning a tabular trace at the end. One launch, one
run, one trace — replaces a `console.log` + edit + rerun loop with a
single deterministic pass.

## Why this exists

For an LLM agent, `console.log` debugging is structurally inefficient:
each iteration is a full recompile + repro, and you have to guess what
to log before knowing what's wrong. A debugger flips the cost model:
many observations per run instead of one log per run. But interactive
step-debugging doesn't suit a one-shot tool environment, so this is
shaped around **capture points** (set N → run once → tabular output).
Real interactive primitives (eval, frames, step) are also exposed.

## Subcommands

```
debug launch  [--session ID] [--restart] [--node|--deno-run|--deno-test] -- <cmd> [args...]
debug rerun   [--session ID]                          # close + relaunch with prior cmd
debug capture [--session ID] <file>:<line> <expr> [<expr>...] [--cond <expr>]
debug bp      [--session ID] <file>:<line> [--cond <expr>]
debug rm      [--session ID] <bpId | file:line>     # bpId removes one; file:line removes every capture at that site
debug run     [--session ID] [--wait <ms>]        # resume + wait for exit
debug continue [--session ID]
debug step    [--session ID] [over|into|out]
debug eval    [--session ID] <expr> [--frame N]
debug trace   [--session ID] [--since N] [--format json|table] [--mark-stack-changes]
              [--partition-by <expr> --out <prefix>]   # one diffable file per partition
debug stacks  [--session ID] [--format json]   # histogram of unique stacks
debug stack   [--session ID] <hit#>            # full stack for one hit
debug status  [--session ID]
debug logs    [--session ID] [--daemon|--stderr|--stdout]
debug close   [--session ID]
debug list
```

Sessions are identified by a short id (default `default`). Multiple
concurrent sessions are supported — each gets its own daemon and Unix
socket under `/tmp/debug-sessions/<id>/`.

## Convenience launch flags

| flag | expands to |
|---|---|
| `--node` | `node --inspect-brk=127.0.0.1:0 ARGS...` |
| `--deno-run` | `deno run --inspect-wait=127.0.0.1:0 -A ARGS...` |
| `--deno-test` | `deno run --inspect-wait=...:0 -A run-test.ts ARGS...` (test shim — see below) |

Without a flag, the command runs as-is and the caller must include
`--inspect-brk=127.0.0.1:0` (or `--inspect-wait`) themselves.

## Quick example (Node)

```sh
$ debug launch --node -- /tmp/sample.js
$ debug capture sample.js:5  i  acc  seed
$ debug run
$ debug trace --format table

#  +ms  loc          i  acc  seed
0  0    sample.js:5  0  0    7
1  1    sample.js:5  1  14   7
2  2    sample.js:5  2  44   7
3  3    sample.js:5  3  106  7
4  4    sample.js:5  4  232  7
```

## Real example (this repo's tests)

Capture every phase transition in a scenario test:

```sh
$ debug launch --deno-test -- test/scenario.test.ts "runGame plays a full game"
$ debug capture src/game/phase-setup.ts:253  state.phase  phase  state.round
$ debug run
$ debug trace --format table

#  +ms  loc                          state.phase    phase         state.round
0  0    src/game/phase-setup.ts:253  CASTLE_SELECT  CANNON_PLACE  1
1  10   src/game/phase-setup.ts:253  CANNON_PLACE   BATTLE        1
2  41   src/game/phase-setup.ts:253  BATTLE         WALL_BUILD    2
3  786  src/game/phase-setup.ts:253  WALL_BUILD     CANNON_PLACE  2
4  797  src/game/phase-setup.ts:253  CANNON_PLACE   BATTLE        2
5  824  src/game/phase-setup.ts:253  BATTLE         WALL_BUILD    3
```

Multiple captures across different src/ files compose:

```sh
$ debug capture src/game/phase-setup.ts:253        state.phase  phase
$ debug capture src/shared/core/game-event-bus.ts:406  type
$ debug run
$ debug trace --format table
# 120-row interleaved trace of every event + every transition
```

## Iterating (n+1 finding)

A finding usually leads to a next question — different captures, maybe a
different filter. Two ways to relaunch without a separate `close`:

```sh
# Same launch line, --restart kills any existing session of that id first.
$ debug launch --session sc --restart --deno-test -- test/foo.test.ts "filter"

# Or: re-use the prior cmd (saved on every launch as cmd.json in the
# session dir). Tighter loop when the cmd doesn't change.
$ debug rerun --session sc
```

Captures are *not* preserved across either path — each run is a fresh
session, deliberately, so the captures stay part of intent.

## Diagnosing why a bp isn't firing

`capture` and `bp` return a `pending: true` flag when V8 hasn't yet bound
the bp to a real location, plus a `hint` explaining why:

```sh
$ debug capture src/foo.ts:64 'x'
{"bpId":"…","via":"urlRegex","pending":true,"hint":"file not yet parsed; bp will retry when its script loads"}

$ debug capture src/game/phase-setup.ts:18 'x'   # line 18 is a comment
{"bpId":"…","via":"urlRegex","pending":true,"hint":"line 18 has no source-map segment; nearest mapped line: 22"}
```

`debug status` includes the same `pending` + `hint` columns for every
capture, so you can audit a setup before running. Common hints:

- `file not yet parsed; bp will retry when its script loads` — usually
  fine for lazy-loaded modules; the [scriptParsed retry](daemon.ts) will
  rebind it.
- `line N has no source-map segment; nearest mapped line: M` — typo, or
  you picked a comment / blank line / multi-line expression continuation.
- `file indexed but no source-map segments anywhere near this line` —
  wrong file path, or line is way off.

## Discovering call sites

Every capture-point hit silently records the top frames from the
`Debugger.paused` event (free — no extra CDP calls). The trace stays
clean by default; query the stacks on demand:

```sh
# Histogram: how many distinct callers? Rolls 326 hits into 18 rows.
$ debug stacks
count  first  last  stack
113      153   321  emitGameEvent ← applyPiecePlacement ← placePiece ← executePlacePiece
95         1    99  emitGameEvent ← tickCastleBuildAnimation ← tickAllCastleBuilds ← …
35       123   254  emitGameEvent ← maybeEmitDescendingWhistle ← tickCannonballs ← …
…

# Drill-down: full chain for one specific hit.
$ debug stack 0
hit 0 @ src/shared/core/game-event-bus.ts:406
  emitGameEvent  (line 98)
  confirmTowerSelection  (line 40)
  …

# Trace with a marker on rows where the stack differs from the previous.
# The △ column flags call-site shifts in an otherwise quiet column.
$ debug trace --format table --mark-stack-changes
#   △  +ms   loc                                    type
0   *    0   …game-event-bus.ts:406                 castlePlaced
1   *    1   …game-event-bus.ts:406                 castleBuildTile     ← different caller
2        6   …game-event-bus.ts:406                 castleBuildTile
3   *   10   …game-event-bus.ts:406                 castlePlaced        ← different caller
…
```

The three compose: marker says *where* the call site shifted, `stacks`
shows the *distribution*, `stack <hit#>` gives the *full chain* for any
one row.

## Filtering with `--cond`

Without filtering, a busy bp can produce hundreds of rows and you're back
to grepping output. `--cond <expr>` evaluates V8-side at hit time — only
hits where the expression is truthy land in the trace, no I/O cost for
skipped ones:

```sh
# All events from emitGameEvent — 120+ rows
$ debug capture src/shared/core/game-event-bus.ts:406  type

# Only phaseStart events — 6 rows
$ debug capture --cond "type === 'phaseStart'" \
    src/shared/core/game-event-bus.ts:406  type  payload.phase  payload.round
```

The condition is plain JavaScript evaluated in the bp's call frame, so it
sees locals, parameters, and `this`.

## Multi-runtime investigations (host vs watcher)

When two runtimes share a process (e.g. host + watcher in
`test/network-vs-local.test.ts`), the same code path executes twice
and you need to tell which run produced each row.

Add a temporary marker to each runtime's state at construction (e.g.
`state.debugTag = "host"` / `"watcher"`), then capture it as a column.
The trace interleaves both runtimes, pre-tagged:

```sh
$ debug capture src/game/battle-system.ts:660 \
    state.debugTag  state.round  state.timer  event.row  event.col
$ debug run
$ debug trace --format table
#  +ms   loc                            state.debugTag  state.round  state.timer  event.row  event.col
0  120   src/game/battle-system.ts:660  host            3            8.17         11         14
1  121   src/game/battle-system.ts:660  watcher         3            6.13         11         14   ← drift here
```

Combine with `--cond "state.round === 3 && event.row === 11"` to surface
only the divergent event.

### Per-peer diffable logs (the `diff` workflow)

For parity-style investigations — "given two peers running the same
code, find the FIRST event where they diverge" — a single interleaved
trace is awkward to scan. `--partition-by <expr> --out <prefix>` writes
one log file per unique value of `<expr>` (typically `state.debugTag`),
each containing that peer's hits in arrival order, formatted so the two
files are directly diffable:

```sh
$ debug capture src/game/battle-system.ts:660 \
    state.debugTag  state.round  event.row  event.col  sid
$ debug run
$ debug trace --partition-by 'state.debugTag' --out /tmp/parity
partitioned trace by state.debugTag:
  /tmp/parity-host.log (1248 hits)
  /tmp/parity-watcher.log (1248 hits)

first-divergence diff:
  diff /tmp/parity-host.log /tmp/parity-watcher.log
```

Each line has the form `file:line key=val key=val …` with sorted keys
and the partition discriminator stripped (it's redundant within a
partition). When both peers hit the same breakpoint the same number of
times in lockstep, line N of each file represents the Nth equivalent
event — so the first `<` / `>` line in `diff` is the first divergent
event.

## Architecture

                           ├─ socket    (Unix socket — IPC server)
                           ├─ ready     (touch file: signals daemon online)
                           ├─ daemon.log
                           ├─ scripts.log    (every Debugger.scriptParsed)
                           ├─ stdout.log     (debuggee stdout)
                           └─ stderr.log     (debuggee stderr)
```

Each CLI invocation is a thin client that connects to the daemon's Unix
socket, sends one JSON request, prints the response. State (breakpoints,
captures, hit log, paused frames) lives in the daemon process.

The daemon defers `Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger` to the `run`
command, giving the CLI a clean window to set captures *before* any
user code executes.

## Files

| file | role |
|---|---|
| [cli.ts](cli.ts) | Subcommand dispatcher + IPC client |
| [daemon.ts](daemon.ts) | Per-session daemon: spawns debuggee, holds CDP, serves IPC |
| [cdp.ts](cdp.ts) | Minimal CDP WebSocket client (no deps) |
| [source-map.ts](source-map.ts) | Source-map decoder (base64 + VLQ + reverse index) |
| [run-test.ts](run-test.ts) | `Deno.test` shim — runs registered tests as plain function calls |

## Why the `Deno.test` shim?

Deno's test runner has two CDP-affecting behaviors that we work around:

1. **`deno test --inspect-brk` wedges**: the runner ignores
   `Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger`, so the runtime never starts. We
   use `--inspect-wait` instead.
2. **`deno test` blocks user breakpoints inside test bodies**: bps fire
   only at the `Deno.test(...)` line, never inside the body. We
   sidestep this by intercepting `Deno.test`, collecting registrations,
   and invoking them ourselves under `deno run`. Same surface, real
   bps.

Implementation: [run-test.ts](run-test.ts). Imports the test file,
`Deno.test` is shimmed to push `{name, fn}` into a list, then we loop
and call each `fn` directly. After all imports resolve, a `debugger;`
statement gives the daemon a chance to rebind any breakpoints whose
target scripts weren't yet parsed at capture-set time.

## Why our own source-map decoder?

V8's built-in `setBreakpointByUrl` source-map resolution produces
broken column numbers for cross-module TS files under Deno (e.g.
returns `columnNumber=802` for a 50-char line — bp fires in the wrong
scope, captured locals come back as `<exception>`). The fix is to
decode the source map ourselves (it's attached as a `data:` URI on
each `Debugger.scriptParsed` event), build a `(tsFile, tsLine) →
(jsScriptId, jsLine, jsCol)` reverse index, and call
`Debugger.setBreakpoint` with the JS coordinate directly. JS files and
plain `node` scripts skip this path entirely.

Resolution order in [setBpResolved](daemon.ts):
1. **sourceMap** — if a parsed script has a source map covering the
   user-given file, use the resolved JS coordinate.
2. **scriptId** — if the file maps directly to a parsed script (plain
   JS, or no source map), use `Debugger.setBreakpoint` with the
   script's own scriptId.
3. **urlRegex** — fallback `Debugger.setBreakpointByUrl` for scripts
   not yet parsed. Re-resolved later via `retryPendingCaptures` after
   the post-import init pause.

## Session files

`/tmp/debug-sessions/<id>/` contents are useful for debugging the
debugger:

- `daemon.log` — daemon's own logs (pause events, retry binds, errors)
- `scripts.log` — every `Debugger.scriptParsed` event,
  one per line: `<scriptId>\t<url>\t[sm:<sourceMapURL>]`
- `stdout.log` / `stderr.log` — debuggee's piped output
- `socket` — the Unix socket (gone when daemon exits)
- `ready` — touch file written when the daemon finishes connecting
- `error` — only present when the daemon failed to start

`debug logs --daemon|--stderr|--stdout` reads the corresponding file.

## Known limitations / future work

- 30-second linger after debuggee exits is hard-coded — `close` is the
  only clean session terminator.
- `close` IPC reply doesn't reach the client because the daemon
  `Deno.exit`s before the response lands. Cosmetic.
- No CLI subcommand for **logpoints** (eval-without-pause, no
  breakpoint surface). The underlying CDP primitive supports it via the
  `condition` field.
- `findScriptForFile` is mostly superseded by the source-map path for
  TS files. Could be unified.
- The shim's `debugger;` statement is the only way the daemon learns
  "imports complete, retry pending captures." A more elegant signal
  (a final `scriptParsed` quiescence period?) would remove the need
  for editing the shim source to add `debugger;`.
